A lot of this is preference based. Just dont use VLC on Desktop as it [alters colors](https://slow.pics/c/qBsQ8AJ0).

# Desktop

### Windows
- **Pot Player**<br/>
  has a good looking UI and is very easy to use<br/>
  [Download](https://potplayer.daum.net)
- **mpv.net**<br/>
  A C# Media Player based on mpv with more UI for customization which makes it a little easier<br/>
  Seems to be hit or miss for some people<br/>
  [Download](https://github.com/stax76/mpv.net/releases/latest)

### Linux
- **Gnome-MPV / Celluloid**<br/>
  An easier to use UI for mpv, still supports all of the scripts that mpv does<br/>
  [Download](https://github.com/celluloid-player/celluloid#Installation)

### Universal
- **mpv**<br/>
  highly customizable, requires manual config, available on Windows/MacOS/Linux<br/>
  [Download](https://mpv.io/installation/)<br/>
  Some Configs you can get:<br/>
  - [LightArrowsExe's Config](https://github.com/LightArrowsEXE/dotfiles/tree/master/mpv) (requires a rather strong pc)<br/>
  - [MPV-Made-Easy by Moodkiller](https://github.com/Moodkiller/MPV-Made-Easy) (includes an "installer")

# Mobile

### Android
- **VLC**<br/>
  VLC using a different rendering engine on Android makes it useable and actually one of the better options<br/>
  May or may not have problems with complex typesetting or kfx<br/>
  [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.videolan.vlc)<br/>[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.videolan.vlc/)<br/>
- **mpv**<br/>
  Practically no manual config needed unlike the desktop version<br/>
  [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=is.xyz.mpv)<br/>
  [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/is.xyz.mpv/)<br/>
- **Kodi**<br/>
  Way more than just a player so it might be overwhelming to use at first<br/>
  [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.xbmc.kodi)<br/>
  [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.xbmc.kodi/)<br/>

### iOS
- **VLC**<br/>
  Same reason as on VLC Android<br/>
  [Download](https://apps.apple.com/app/vlc-for-mobile/id650377962)
- **Infuse**<br/>
  Very easy to use, more of a media manager & player in one<br/>
  [Download](https://apps.apple.com/app/infuse-6/id1136220934)
- **Documents**<br/>
  A Filemanager that can be used similarly to a media center<br/>
