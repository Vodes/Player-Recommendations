A lot of this is preference based. Just dont use VLC on Desktop as it [alters colors](https://slow.pics/c/qBsQ8AJ0).

# Desktop

### Windows
- **Pot Player**<br/>
  has a good looking UI and is very easy to use<br/>
  [Download](https://potplayer.daum.net)
- **mpv.net**<br/>
  A C# Port of mpv with more UI for customization which makes it a little easier<br/>
  Seems to be hit or miss for some people<br/>
  [Download](https://github.com/stax76/mpv.net/releases/latest)
  
### Linux
- **Gnome-MPV / Celluloid**<br/>
  An easier to use UI for mpv, still supports all of the scripts that mpv does<br/>
  [Download](https://github.com/celluloid-player/celluloid#Installation)
  
### Universal
- **mpv**<br/>
  highly customizable, requires manual config, available on Windows/MacOS/Linux<br/>
  [Download](https://mpv.io/installation/)
  

# Mobile

### Android
- **VLC**<br/>
  VLC using a different rendering engine on Android makes it useable and actually one of the better options<br/>

- **MX Player (Pro)** <br/>
  Easy to use, performs better than VLC but the non-pro Version has ads which are annoying<br/>
  [Download](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mxtech.videoplayer.ad)<br/>[Buy (Pro)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mxtech.videoplayer.pro)</br>[Mirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/mx-media-entertainment-formerly-j2-interactive/mx-player/)
- **mpv** <br/>
  Requires less manual config than on desktop since inputs are predefined<br/>
  [Download](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=is.xyz.mpv)<br/>
  [Mirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/prismriver-media/mpv-android/)
  
### iOS
- **VLC**<br/>
  Same reason as on VLC Android<br/>
  [Download](https://apps.apple.com/app/vlc-for-mobile/id650377962)
- **Infuse**<br/>
  Very easy to use, more of a media manager & player in one<br/>
